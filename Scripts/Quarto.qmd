## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
y = 5
x + y
z <- c(3, 7, 2)
z = c(3, 7, 2)
b = 10
class(b)
is.vector(z)
b = "Hipertenso"
c = ">65 a√±os"
d = "caracter"
is.vector(b)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
